# WeatherStation 
This Arduino scetch is build to show 4 weather measurments:
 - temperature 
 - humidity 
 - pressure 
 - concentration of pm2 dust
 
 I *will* add graphic with all the connections later. 
 
 ### Components used in project:
 - Arduino Uno 
 - GP2Y1010AU0F sensor + module Waveshare 10500
 - BME280 sensor 
 - SSD1206 display
